# Josh Persson CSCIE-15 Project 2
+ By: *Joshua Persson*
+ Production URL: <http://p2.shua-page.com>

## Outside resources
*For writing to JSON:*
[PHP Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php)





## 3 Unique inputs
The three unique inputs I used were:
 	1. Text input for Project ID.
	1. Dropdown for Project year.
	1. Radio button for Project discipline.

## Class
*This project used Form.php to validate the input from the POST submission from the project entry form on the top half of the page*



## Notes for instructor
*User submits project information by the form in the first half of the page which writes to projects.json (included). The user can then search projects.json for projecs using the form at the bottom of the page*
